		<p>*<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/022916/what-502030-budget-rule.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Needs</a> are those bills that you absolutely must pay and are the things necessary for survival. These include rent or mortgage payments, car payments, groceries, insurance, health care, minimum debt payment and utilities.</p>
<p>
*<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/022916/what-502030-budget-rule.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wants</a> are all the things you spend money on that are not absolutely essential. This includes dinner and movies out, that new handbag, tickets to sporting events, vacations, the latest electronics gadget and ultra-high-speed Internet. Basically, wants are all those little extras you spend money on that make life more enjoyable and entertaining.

<p>
*<a href="https://debtbusters.com.au/blog/why-you-should-try-the-50-20-30-budget-rule/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Savings</a> should include any and all savings such as your emergency fund, vacation fund, shopping fund etc. This may include investments and any extra money you’re putting towards credit card and/or loan payments or your super (above the standard 9%).
