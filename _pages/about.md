<h2>THE PROBLEM</h2>
Youth homelessness keeps contributing to the increasing population of homeless people.Teenagers are more vulnerable and possible to perpetrate crime under tough environment as compared to adults. Young adults having financial difficulties are likely to face homelessness.

Young teenagers are inexperienced, and they find it difficult to realize their problem and look for a solution.
